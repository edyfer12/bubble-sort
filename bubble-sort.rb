#Define a method that will sort the array via bubble sort and return a new array

    #Declare a sentinel variable, allSwapped and set to false
    #Declare and set variable counter to 1
    #Set a infinite loop until all elements in the array are sorted in ascending order
        #Loop from 1 to the last index of the array to compare between two values
            #If the left element is greater than the right element, swap the values
            #Otherwise, keep iterating
        #If all values are sorted in ascending order end the infinite loop
    #Return the array

#Invoke the bubble sort method that returns the array sorted and display to the user
